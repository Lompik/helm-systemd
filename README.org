#+TITLE: helm interface to interact with systemd units

This package lets you Start/Restart/Stop and view status of systemd's units with helm.

Main keys are ~tab~ to select either of Start/Restart/Stop and ~C-j~ to view the selected unit status in a special buffer. User's units come in a separate source, ~C-o~ to switch to the latter. Systemd's unit type (service, timers, mount, etc) can be circled with ~C-[~ and ~C-]~.

* Configuration

| variable                     | description                            |
|------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| helm-systemd-list-all        | Pass "--all" argument to systemd       |
| helm-systemd-list-not-loaded | also show unit that are not yet loaded |
If you don't see some units, set those 2 variables to ~t~.

* TODOs
Ideas for improvement goes here.
  - Provide feedback on systemd restart/stop status
  - persistent restart/stop actions
  - async action, especially restart
