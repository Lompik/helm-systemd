#+TITLE: helm interface to interact woth systemd units

This package lets you Start/Restart/Stop and view status of systemd's units with helm.

Main keys are ~tab~ to select either of Start/Restart/Stop and ~C-j~ to view the selected unit status in a special buffer. User's unit comes in a separate source, ~C-o~ to switch to the latter. Systemd's unit type (service, timers, mount, etc) can be circled with ~C-[~ and ~C-]~.
